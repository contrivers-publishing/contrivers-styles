# Contrivers-Sass

Sass, Javascript, and *test* images for [Contrivers'
Review](http://www.contrivers.org).

## Development

1. Install [nodejs](http://nodejs.org) 
    
    ```
    $ node --version
    v0.10.33
    ```
2. Verify that you have [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org)
    
    ```
    $ npm --version
    2.1.6
    ```

3. Install [bower](http://bower.io) and [grunt](http://gruntjs.com) globally.
    
    ```
    $ npm -g install bower
    $ npm -g install grunt-cli
    ```

4. Install [Bundler](http://bundler.io/).
    
    ```
    $ gem install bundler
    ```

5. Clone the repo.
    
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/lmergner/contrivers-sass.git
    $ cd contrivers-sass
    ```

6. Install local node dependencies (must be in working directory).

    `$ npm install `

    Note that if phantomjs throws an error, you may need to install that [tool
    manually](http://phantomjs.org/download.html). This is only necessary if
    you intend to use the visual regression tool described below. On OSX, you 
    can `brew install phantomjs`.

7. Run the grunt task that will install the development dependencies via grunt and bower.

    ```
    $ grunt bootstrap
    ```

8. Create the [Hologram](https://github.com/trulia/hologram)
  [Styleguide](http://localhost:9001) with the default compass task, which runs
  the node connect server, a compass compiler watch task, and the hologram
  build watch task. If you install the [live reload](http://livereload.com)
  bowerser extension, the page should auto-reload after you make changes to the
  sass files.
    ```
    $ grunt 
    ```

- Open up the `sass/` directory and hack away.


## Sass Libraries

- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
    > Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS
    > extension language in the world.

- [Compass](http://compass-style.org/)
    > Compass is an open-source CSS Authoring Framework.

    Note that I use the vertical rhythm tools in Compass for vertical spacing.

- [Breakpoint](http://breakpoint-sass.com)
    > Breakpoint makes writing media queries in Sass super simple.

- [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net)
    A grid framework for Sass. [Docs](http://susydocs.oddbird.net/en/latest/).

    Note that I use the gutter, etc. math in Susy for horizontal spacing.

## Javscript Libraries

- [Bigfoot.js](http://www.bigfootjs.com)
    > A jQuery plugin for empowering footnotes

- [eq.js](https://github.com/Snugug/eq.js)
    > Lightweight JavaScript powered element queries
        
    I am strongly considering dropping this library and rewriting all my
    element queries as window queries in Breakpoint. As it is, this libraries
    is only used in a few places and not well.

## Regression Tests

This feature isn't fully implemented. But it uses a grunt task to run
[PhantomCSS](https://github.com/Huddle/PhantomCSS). Baseline images are
committed to `phantomcss/baseline` and results are created in
`phantomcss/results`. Tests are written in [CasperJS](http://casperjs.org/) on
top of [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org). This is not really implemented
because I don't really understand how all the parts work together yet and I'm
relying on the grunt task to do the setup and test-running.  I believe that 
installing the grunt-phantomcss in the package.json file should install the 
necessary libraries.
