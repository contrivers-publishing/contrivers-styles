## Markdown Styles

Example html taken from [markdown.css](http://mrcoles.com/demo/markdown-css/)

```html_example

<h1>HTML that looks like markdown</h1>

<p>When this section is styled by <code>markdown.css</code> it looks like plain-text, despite being HTML. Inspect it with firebug or click on &lt;HTML/&gt; to see the markup.</p>

<p>A <strong>strong tag</strong> and an <em>em tag</em> get styled like so.</p>
<p>How about a link to <a href="http://mrcoles.com">my site</a>?</p>

<h2>H2 header</h2>

<h3>Lists</h3>
<ul>
    <li>they look like this</li>
    <li>it’s how you’d format them in pure markdown, if you took the time to indent when it wrapped to a new line.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ordered lists</h3>
<ol>
    <li>here’s one line from a numbered list</li>
    <li>here’s another</li>
    <li>in markdown, the actual numbers don’t matter—you can toggle this with the class <a href="#" onclick="$('body').toggleClass('markdown-ones');return false"><code>markdown-ones</code></a></li>
</ol>

<h3>Block quotes</h3>
<blockquote>
    This is a blockquote that extends<br>
    to multiple lines.<br><br>
    With repeating email-style angle brackets.
</blockquote>


<h3>Code blocks</h3>
<pre><code>(function() {
    console.log('code blocks indent four spaces');
})()</code></pre>

<h3>Different headers</h3>

<h4>h4 header</h4>
<h5>h5 header</h5>
<h6>h6 header</h6>

<hr>

<p>That’s an hr above. It just works!</p>

<p>
    However, images will still look like images. Deal with it.
</p>

<p>
    <img alt="kitten" src="http://placekitten.com/g/180/200">

<h3>Blockquotes</h3>
<p>This is what a sample blockquote looks like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Then listen to me." Franz then related to his friend the history of his
excursion to the Island of Monte Cristo and of his finding a party of
smugglers there, and the two Corsican bandits with them. He dwelt with
considerable force and energy on the almost magical hospitality he had
received from the count, and the magnificence of his entertainment in the
grotto of the "Thousand and One Nights." He recounted, with circumstantial
exactitude, all the particulars of the supper, the hashish, the statues, the
dream, and how, at his awakening, there remained no proof or trace of all
these events, save the small yacht, seen in the distant horizon driving under
full sail toward Porto-Vecchio.</p>
<p>Then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the Colosseum,
between the count and Vampa, in which the count had promised to obtain the
release of the bandit Peppino, - an engagement which, as our readers are
aware, he most faithfully fulfilled. At last he arrived at the adventure of
the preceding night, and the embarrassment in which he found himself placed
by not having sufficient cash by six or seven hundred piastres to make up the
sum required, and finally of his application to the count and the picturesque
and satisfactory result that followed.</p>
</blockquote>
 fourth list element is lazy.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Forms and Buttons</h3>
<p>Here's a sample form:</p>
<form>
  <input type="text" size="30" />
  <br>
  <label>
      <input type="checkbox" />
      <span>This is text accompanying the checkbox</span>
  </label><br>
  <label>
      <input type="checkbox" />
      <span>More text with a different checkbox</span>
  </label>
  <br><br>
  <select>
    <option>Select an option</option>
    <option>One</option>
    <option>Two</option>
  </select>
  <br>

<button type="submit">Sample Button</button>
</form>
https://github.com/mrcoles/markdown-css">github</a>
</p>
```
