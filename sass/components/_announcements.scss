What do I call things that are on the front page,
but are not styled `block` elements.

```html_example

<div style='max-width: 500px; margin: 1em auto;' class='announcement'>
    Browse our latest issue on <a href="#">the Digital Humanities</a>.
</div>

<div style='max-width: 500px; margin: 1em auto;' class='announcement' >
    <h3>Fundraising</h3>
    <p><a href=''>Contrivers' Review</a> is currently fundraising for its
    first issue of 2015. Throughout the year, we'll be publishing 
    essays discussing the impact of technology on education, philosophy, 
    society, and politics. To help us, click <a href=''>here for more
